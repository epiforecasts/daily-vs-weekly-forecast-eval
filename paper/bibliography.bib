	abstract = {Infectious disease outbreaks recapitulate biology: they emerge from the multi-level interaction of hosts, pathogens, and environment. Therefore, outbreak forecasting requires an integrative approach to modeling. While specific components of outbreaks are predictable, it remains unclear whether fundamental limits to outbreak prediction exist. Here, adopting permutation entropy as a model independent measure of predictability, we study the predictability of a diverse collection of outbreaks and identify a fundamental entropy barrier for disease time series forecasting. However, this barrier is often beyond the time scale of single outbreaks, implying prediction is likely to succeed. We show that forecast horizons vary by disease and that both shifting model structures and social network heterogeneity are likely mechanisms for differences in predictability. Our results highlight the importance of embracing dynamic modeling approaches, suggest challenges for performing model selection across long time series, and may relate more broadly to the predictability of complex adaptive systems.},

The WCIS provides a pragmatic utility-based characterization of probabilistic predictions, developed in response to the challenge of evaluating forecast performances in the turbulent context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Current widely-used scoring techniques generally fall into two groups: those that generate an individually interpretable metric, and those that generate a comparable and aggregable metric. The WCIS harmonizes these attributes, resulting in a normalized score that is nevertheless intuitively representative of the in-situ quality of individual forecasts. This method is expressly intended to enable practitioners and policy-makers who may not have expertise in forecasting but are nevertheless essential partners in epidemic response to use and provide insightful analysis of predictions. In this paper, we detail the methodology of the WCIS and demonstrate its utility in the context of US state-level COVID-19 predictions.},

	abstract = {For practical reasons, many forecasts of case, hospitalization, and death counts in the context of the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are issued in the form of central predictive intervals at various levels. This is also the case for the forecasts collected in the COVID-19 Forecast Hub (https://covid19forecasthub.org/). Forecast evaluation metrics like the logarithmic score, which has been applied in several infectious disease forecasting challenges, are then not available as they require full predictive distributions. This article provides an overview of how established methods for the evaluation of quantile and interval forecasts can be applied to epidemic forecasts in this format. Specifically, we discuss the computation and interpretation of the weighted interval score, which is a proper score that approximates the continuous ranked probability score. It can be interpreted as a generalization of the absolute error to probabilistic forecasts and allows for a decomposition into a measure of sharpness and penalties for over- and underprediction.},

	abstract = {Background: Assessing temporal variations in transmission in different countries is essential for monitoring the epidemic, evaluating the effectiveness of public health interventions and estimating the impact of changes in policy.  Methods: We use case and death notification data to generate daily estimates of the time-varying reproduction number globally, regionally, nationally, and subnationally over a 12-week rolling window. Our modelling framework, based on open source tooling, accounts for uncertainty in reporting delays, so that the reproduction number is estimated based on underlying latent infections.  Results: Estimates of the reproduction number, trajectories of infections, and forecasts are displayed on a dedicated website as both maps and time series, and made available to download in tabular form.  Conclusions:  This decision-support tool can be used to assess changes in virus transmission both globally, regionally, nationally, and subnationally. This allows public health officials and policymakers to track the progress of the outbreak in near real-time using an epidemiologically valid measure. As well as providing regular updates on our website, we also provide an open source tool-set so that our approach can be used directly by researchers and policymakers on confidential data-sets. We hope that our tool will be used to support decisions in countries worldwide throughout the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.},

	abstract = {Forecasting transmission of infectious diseases, especially for vector-borne diseases, poses unique challenges for researchers. Behaviors of and interactions between viruses, vectors, hosts, and the environment each play a part in determining the transmission of a disease. Public health surveillance systems and other sources provide valuable data that can be used to accurately forecast disease incidence. However, many aspects of common infectious disease surveillance data are imperfect: cases may be reported with a delay or in some cases not at all, data on vectors may not be available, and case data may not be available at high geographical or temporal resolution. In the face of these challenges, researchers must make assumptions to either account for these underlying processes in a mechanistic model or to justify their exclusion altogether in a statistical model. Whether a model is mechanistic or statistical, researchers should evaluate their model using accepted best practices from the emerging field of infectious disease forecasting while adopting conventions from other fields that have been developing forecasting methods for decades. Accounting for assumptions and properly evaluating models will allow researchers to generate forecasts that have the potential to provide valuable insights for public health officials. This chapter provides a background to the practice of forecasting in general, discusses the biological and statistical models used for infectious disease forecasting, presents technical details about making and evaluating forecasting models, and explores the issues in communicating forecasting results in a public health context.},

	abstract = {Scoring rules assess the quality of probabilistic forecasts, by assigning a numerical score based on the predictive distribution and on the event or value that materializes. A scoring rule is proper if the forecaster maximizes the expected score for an observation drawn from the distributionF if he or she issues the probabilistic forecast F, rather than G ≠ F. It is strictly proper if the maximum is unique. In prediction problems, proper scoring rules encourage the forecaster to make careful assessments and to be honest. In estimation problems, strictly proper scoring rules provide attractive loss and utility functions that can be tailored to the problem at hand. This article reviews and develops the theory of proper scoring rules on general probability spaces, and proposes and discusses examples thereof. Proper scoring rules derive from convex functions and relate to information measures, entropy functions, and Bregman divergences. In the case of categorical variables, we prove a rigorous version of the Savage representation. Examples of scoring rules for probabilistic forecasts in the form of predictive densities include the logarithmic, spherical, pseudospherical, and quadratic scores. The continuous ranked probability score applies to probabilistic forecasts that take the form of predictive cumulative distribution functions. It generalizes the absolute error and forms a special case of a new and very general type of score, the energy score. Like many other scoring rules, the energy score admits a kernel representation in terms of negative definite functions, with links to inequalities of Hoeffding type, in both univariate and multivariate settings. Proper scoring rules for quantile and interval forecasts are also discussed. We relate proper scoring rules to Bayes factors and to cross-validation, and propose a novel form of cross-validation known as random-fold cross-validation. A case study on probabilistic weather forecasts in the North American Pacific Northwest illustrates the importance of propriety. We note optimum score approaches to point and quantile estimation, and propose the intuitively appealing interval score as a utility function in interval estimation that addresses width as well as coverage.},

	abstract = {The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2020. Currently, there are no vaccines or treatments that have been approved after clinical trials. Social distancing measures, including travel bans, school closure, and quarantine applied to countries or regions are being used to limit the spread of the disease, and the demand on the healthcare infrastructure. The seclusion of groups and individuals has led to limited access to accurate information. To update the public, especially in South Africa, announcements are made by the minister of health daily. These announcements narrate the confirmed COVID-19 cases and include the age, gender, and travel history of people who have tested positive for the disease. Additionally, the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases updates a daily infographic summarising the number of tests performed, confirmed cases, mortality rate, and the regions affected. However, the age of the patient and other nuanced data regarding the transmission is only shared in the daily announcements and not on the updated infographic. To disseminate this information, the Data Science for Social Impact research group at the University of Pretoria, South Africa, has worked on curating and applying publicly available data in a way that is computer readable so that information can be shared to the public – using both a data repository and a dashboard. Through collaborative practices, a variety of challenges related to publicly available data in South Africa came to the fore. These include shortcomings in the accessibility, integrity, and data management practices between governmental departments and the South African public. In this paper, solutions to these problems will be shared by using a publicly available data repository and dashboard as a case study. Dashboard: https://dsfsi.github.io/covid19za-dash/, Data repository: https://github.com/dsfsi/covid19za.},

We also introduce a collection of quantile-based local efficiency measures, along with a practical approach for computing Monte Carlo error estimates for quantiles.

This study compares the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) approaches in forecasting infectious disease incidences across different countries and time intervals. We forecasted three diverse diseases: campylobacteriosis, typhoid, and Q-fever, using a wide variety of features (n = 46) from public datasets, e.g., landscape, climate, and socioeconomic factors. We compared autoregressive statistical models to two tree-based ML models (extreme gradient boosted trees [XGB] and random forest [RF]) and two DL models (multi-layer perceptron and encoder–decoder model). The disease models were trained on data from seven different countries at the region-level between 2009–2017. Forecasting performance of all models was assessed using mean absolute error, root mean square error, and Poisson deviance across Australia, Israel, and the United States for the months of January through August of 2018. The overall model results were compared across diseases as well as various data splits, including country, regions with highest and lowest cases, and the forecasted months out (i.e., nowcasting, short-term, and long-term forecasting). Overall, the XGB models performed the best for all diseases and, in general, tree-based ML models performed the best when looking at data splits. There were a few instances where the statistical or DL models had minutely smaller error metrics for specific subsets of typhoid, which is a disease with very low case counts. Feature importance per disease was measured by using four tree-based ML models (i.e., XGB and RF with and without region name as a feature). The most important feature groups included previous case counts, region name, population counts and density, mortality causes of neonatal to under 5 years of age, sanitation factors, and elevation. This study demonstrates the power of ML approaches to incorporate a wide range of factors to forecast various diseases, regardless of location, more accurately than traditional statistical approaches.},

	abstract = {Influenza infects an estimated 9–35 million individuals each year in the United States and is a contributing cause for between 12,000 and 56,000 deaths annually. Seasonal outbreaks of influenza are common in temperate regions of the world, with highest incidence typically occurring in colder and drier months of the year. Real-time forecasts of influenza transmission can inform public health response to outbreaks. We present the results of a multiinstitution collaborative effort to standardize the collection and evaluation of forecasting models for influenza in the United States for the 2010/2011 through 2016/2017 influenza seasons. For these seven seasons, we assembled weekly real-time forecasts of seven targets of public health interest from 22 different models. We compared forecast accuracy of each model relative to a historical baseline seasonal average. Across all regions of the United States, over half of the models showed consistently better performance than the historical baseline when forecasting incidence of influenza-like illness 1 wk, 2 wk, and 3 wk ahead of available data and when forecasting the timing and magnitude of the seasonal peak. In some regions, delays in data reporting were strongly and negatively associated with forecast accuracy. More timely reporting and an improved overall accessibility to novel and traditional data sources are needed to improve forecasting accuracy and its integration with real-time public health decision making.},

Throughout 2015, we invited public health practitioners belonging to three national public health organizations to complete a cross-sectional survey containing questions on model awareness, model use, and communication with modelers. Of 39 respondents, 46.15\% used models in their work, and 20.51\% reported direct communication with those who create models. Over half (64.10\%) were aware that influenza forecasts exist. The need for improved communication between practitioners and modelers was overwhelmingly endorsed, with over 50\% of participants indicating the need for models more relevant to public health questions, increased frequency of telecommunication, and more plain language in discussing models. Model use for public health decision making must be improved if models are to reach their full potential as public health tools. Increased quality and frequency of communication between practitioners and modelers could be particularly useful in achieving this goal. It is important that improvements be made now, rather than waiting for the next public health crisis to occur.},

Here, we find SMH performance varied widely as a function of both scenario validity and model calibration. We show scenarios remained close to reality for 22 weeks on average before the arrival of unanticipated SARS-CoV-2 variants invalidated key assumptions. An ensemble of participating models that preserved variation between models (using the linear opinion pool method) was consistently more reliable than any single model in periods of valid scenario assumptions, while projection interval coverage was near target levels. SMH projections were used to guide pandemic response, illustrating the value of collaborative hubs for longer-term scenario projections.},

	abstract = {Forecasting the dynamics of influenza outbreaks could be useful for decision-making regarding the allocation of public health resources. Reliable forecasts could also aid in the selection and implementation of interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality due to influenza illness. This paper reviews methods for influenza forecasting proposed during previous influenza outbreaks and those evaluated in hindsight. We discuss the various approaches, in addition to the variability in measures of accuracy and precision of predicted measures. PubMed and Google Scholar searches for articles on influenza forecasting retrieved sixteen studies that matched the study criteria. We focused on studies that aimed at forecasting influenza outbreaks at the local, regional, national, or global level. The selected studies spanned a wide range of regions including USA, Sweden, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, United Kingdom, Canada, France, and Cuba. The methods were also applied to forecast a single measure or multiple measures. Typical measures predicted included peak timing, peak height, daily/weekly case counts, and outbreak magnitude. Due to differences in measures used to assess accuracy, a single estimate of predictive error for each of the measures was difficult to obtain. However, collectively, the results suggest that these diverse approaches to influenza forecasting are capable of capturing specific outbreak measures with some degree of accuracy given reliable data and correct disease assumptions. Nonetheless, several of these approaches need to be evaluated and their performance quantified in real-time predictions.},

We performed a systematic review of 26 manuscripts, published between 2014 and April 2015, that forecasted the West African Ebola outbreak while it was occurring, and we derived implications for how results could be interpreted by policymakers. Forecasted case counts varied widely. An important determinant of forecast accuracy for case counts was how far into the future predictions were made. Generally, forecasts for less than 2 months into the future tended to be more accurate than those made for more than 10 weeks into the future. The exceptions were parsimonious statistical models in which the decay of the rate of spread of the pathogen among susceptible individuals was dealt with explicitly. The most important lessons for policymakers regarding future outbreaks, when using similar modeling results, are: 1) uncertainty of forecasts will be greater in the beginning of the outbreak; 2) when data are limited, forecasts produced by models designed to inform specific decisions should be used complementarily for robust decision-making (e.g., 2 statistical models produced the most reliable case-counts forecasts for the studied Ebola outbreak but did not enable understanding of interventions’ impact, whereas several compartmental models could estimate interventions’ impact but required unavailable data); and 3) timely collection of essential data is necessary for optimal model use.},

We determined the distributions of the incubation period for the Alpha and Delta variants using information on negative polymerase chain reaction tests and the date of last exposure from 282 symptomatic cases. We estimated the distributions of the intrinsic generation time using a Bayesian inference approach applied to 9724 SARS-CoV-2 cases clustered in 3545 households where at least one secondary case was recorded. We estimated a mean incubation period of 4.9 days (95\% credible intervals, CrI, 4.4–5.4) for Alpha and 4.5 days (95\% CrI 4.0–5.0) for Delta. The intrinsic generation time was estimated to have a mean of 7.12 days (95\% CrI 6.27–8.44) for Alpha and of 6.52 days (95\% CrI 5.54–8.43) for Delta. The household serial interval was 2.43 days (95\% CrI 2.29–2.58) for Alpha and 2.74 days (95\% CrI 2.62–2.88) for Delta, and the estimated proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was 48–51\% for both variants. These results indicate limited differences in the incubation period and intrinsic generation time of SARS-CoV-2 variants Alpha and Delta compared to ancestral lineages.},

We compared the predictive performance of these forecasts to those of two mathematical models with different spatial interaction components.An ensemble combining the forecasts of all experts performed similarly to the two models. Experts showed stronger bias than models forecasting two-case threshold exceedance. Experts and models both performed better when predicting exceedance of higher thresholds. The models also tended to be better at risk-ranking areas than experts.Our results support the use of models in outbreak contexts, offering a convenient and scalable route to a quantified situational awareness, which can provide confidence in or to call into question existing advice of experts.

	abstract = {Real-time forecasts based on mathematical models can inform critical decision-making during infectious disease outbreaks. Yet, epidemic forecasts are rarely evaluated during or after the event, and there is little guidance on the best metrics for assessment. Here, we propose an evaluation approach that disentangles different components of forecasting ability using metrics that separately assess the calibration, sharpness and bias of forecasts. This makes it possible to assess not just how close a forecast was to reality but also how well uncertainty has been quantified. We used this approach to analyse the performance of weekly forecasts we generated in real time for Western Area, Sierra Leone, during the 2013–16 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. We investigated a range of forecast model variants based on the model fits generated at the time with a semi-mechanistic model, and found that good probabilistic calibration was achievable at short time horizons of one or two weeks ahead but model predictions were increasingly unreliable at longer forecasting horizons. This suggests that forecasts may have been of good enough quality to inform decision making based on predictions a few weeks ahead of time but not longer, reflecting the high level of uncertainty in the processes driving the trajectory of the epidemic. Comparing forecasts based on the semi-mechanistic model to simpler null models showed that the best semi-mechanistic model variant performed better than the null models with respect to probabilistic calibration, and that this would have been identified from the earliest stages of the outbreak. As forecasts become a routine part of the toolkit in public health, standards for evaluation of performance will be important for assessing quality and improving credibility of mathematical models, and for elucidating difficulties and trade-offs when aiming to make the most useful and reliable forecasts.},

	abstract = {Professor Pierre Magal made important contributions to the field of mathematical biology before his death on February 20, 2024, including research in which epidemiological models were used to study the ends of infectious disease outbreaks. In related work, there has been interest in inferring (in real-time) when outbreaks have ended and control interventions can be relaxed. Here, we analyse data from the 2018 Ebola outbreak in Équateur Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo, during which an Ebola Response Team (ERT) was deployed to implement public health measures. We use a renewal equation transmission model to perform a quasi real-time investigation into when the ERT could be withdrawn safely at the tail end of the outbreak. Specifically, each week following the arrival of the ERT, we calculate the probability of future cases if the ERT is withdrawn. First, we show that similar estimates of the probability of future cases can be obtained from either daily or weekly case reports. This demonstrates that high temporal resolution case reporting may not always be necessary to determine when interventions can be relaxed. Second, we demonstrate how case under-reporting can be accounted for rigorously when estimating the probability of future cases. We find that, the lower the level of case reporting, the longer it is necessary to wait after the apparent final case before interventions can be removed safely (with only a small probability of additional cases). Finally, we show how uncertainty in the extent of case reporting can be included in estimates of the probability of future cases. Our research highlights the importance of accounting for under-reporting in deciding when to remove interventions at the tail ends of infectious disease outbreaks.},

	abstract = {For infectious disease forecasting challenges, individual model performance typically varies across space and time. This phenomenon raises the question: are there properties of the target time series that contribute to a particular season, location, or disease being more difficult to forecast? Here we characterize a time series’ future predictability using a forecastability metric that calculates the spectral density of the time series. Forecastability of syndromic influenza hospital admissions for the state of California varied widely across seasons and was positively correlated with peak burden. Next, using archived U.S. state and national forecasts targeting laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and influenza hospital admissions, we investigated the relationship between forecastability and: (i) population size of the forecasting target, and (ii) forecast performance as measured by mean absolute error, weighted interval score (WIS), and scaled relative WIS. Forecastability increased with increasing population size of the forecasting target, and forecasting performance generally improved with higher forecastability when controlling for population size across scales. These preliminary results support the idea that some targets and respiratory virus seasons may be inherently more difficult to forecast and could help explain inter-seasonal variation in model performance.},

	abstract = {Disease surveillance is an integral component of government policy, allowing public health professionals to monitor transmission of infectious diseases and appropriately apply interventions. To aid with surveillance efforts, there has been extensive development of mathematical models to help inform policy decisions, However, these mathematical models rely upon data streams that are expensive and often only practical for high income countries. With a growing focus on equitable public health tools there is a dire need for development of mathematical models that are equipped to handle the data stream challenges prevalent in low and middle income countries, where data is often incomplete and subject to aggregation. To address this need, we develop a mathematical model for the joint estimation of the effective reproduction number and daily incidence of an infectious disease using incomplete and aggregated data. Our investigation demonstrates that this novel mathematical model is robust across a variety of reduced data streams, making it suitable for application in diverse regions.
Author summary Monitoring the transmission of infectious diseases is an important part of government policy that is often hindered by limitations in data streams. This is especially true in low and middle income countries where health sectors have less funding. In this work we develop a mathematical model to enhance disease surveillance by overcoming these data limitations, providing accurate inferences of relevant epidemiological parameters.},

Producing accurate and actionable forecasts of infectious disease incidence at short and long time scales will improve public health response to outbreaks. However, scientists and public health officials face many obstacles in trying to create such real-time forecasts of infectious disease incidence. Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus that annually infects over 400 million people worldwide. We developed a real-time forecasting model for dengue hemorrhagic fever in the 77 provinces of Thailand. We created a practical computational infrastructure that generated multi-step predictions of dengue incidence in Thai provinces every two weeks throughout 2014. These predictions show mixed performance across provinces, out-performing seasonal baseline models in over half of provinces at a 2 month horizon. Additionally, to assess the degree to which delays in case reporting make long-range prediction a challenging task, we compared the performance of our real-time predictions with predictions made with fully reported data. This paper provides valuable lessons for the implementation of real-time predictions in the context of public health decision making.},

	abstract = {Recent years have seen increasing efforts to forecast infectious disease burdens, with a primary goal being to help public health workers make informed policy decisions. However, there has been only limited discussion of how predominant forecast evaluation metrics might indicate the success of policies based in part on those forecasts. We explore one possible tether between forecasts and policy: the allocation of limited medical resources so as to minimize unmet need. We use probabilistic forecasts of disease burden in each of several regions to determine optimal resource allocations, and then we score forecasts according to how much unmet need their associated allocations would have allowed. We illustrate with forecasts of COVID-19 hospitalizations in the U.S., and we find that the forecast skill ranking given by this allocation scoring rule can vary substantially from the ranking given by the weighted interval score. We see this as evidence that the allocation scoring rule detects forecast value that is missed by traditional accuracy measures and that the general strategy of designing scoring rules that are directly linked to policy performance is a promising direction for epidemic forecast evaluation.},

	abstract = {The time-varying reproduction number (Rt) is an important measure of epidemic transmissibility that directly informs policy decisions and the optimisation of control measures. EpiEstim is a widely used opensource software tool that uses case incidence and the serial interval (SI, time between symptoms in a case and their infector) to estimate Rt in real-time. The incidence and the SI distribution must be provided at the same temporal resolution, which can limit the applicability of EpiEstim and other similar methods, e.g. for contexts where the time window of incidence reporting is longer than the mean SI. In the EpiEstim R package, we implement an expectation-maximisation algorithm to reconstruct daily incidence from temporally aggregated data, from which Rt can then be estimated. We assess the validity of our method using an extensive simulation study and apply it to COVID-19 and influenza data. For all datasets, the influence of intra-weekly variability in reported data was mitigated by using aggregated weekly data. Rt estimated on weekly sliding windows using incidence reconstructed from weekly data was strongly correlated with estimates from the original daily data. The simulation study revealed that Rt was well estimated in all scenarios and regardless of the temporal aggregation of the data. In the presence of weekend effects, Rt estimates from reconstructed data were more successful at recovering the true value of Rt than those obtained from reported daily data. These results show that this novel method allows Rt to be successfully recovered from aggregated data using a simple approach with very few data requirements. Additionally, by removing administrative noise when daily incidence data are reconstructed, the accuracy of Rt estimates can be improved.},

	abstract = {During infectious disease outbreaks, the time-dependent reproduction number (𝑅𝑡) can be estimated to monitor pathogen transmission. In previous work, we developed a simulation-based method for estimating 𝑅𝑡 from temporally aggregated disease incidence data (e.g. weekly case reports). While that approach is straightforward to use, it assumes implicitly that all cases are reported and the computation can be slow when applied to large datasets. In this article, we extend our previous approach and develop a computationally efficient simulation-based method for estimating 𝑅𝑡 in real-time accounting for both temporal aggregation of incidence data and under-reporting (with a fixed reporting probability per case). Using simulated data, we show that failing to consider stochastic under-reporting can lead to inappropriately precise estimates, including scenarios in which the true 𝑅𝑡 value lies outside inferred credible intervals more often than expected. We then apply our approach to data from the 2018 to 2020 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), again exploring the effects of case under-reporting. Finally, we show how our method can be extended to account for temporal variations in reporting. Given information about the level of case reporting, our framework can be used to estimate 𝑅𝑡 during future outbreaks with under-reported and temporally aggregated case data.

	abstract = {Tracking pathogen transmissibility during infectious disease outbreaks is essential for assessing the effectiveness of public health measures and planning future control strategies. A key measure of transmissibility is the time-dependent reproduction number, which has been estimated in real-time during outbreaks of a range of pathogens from disease incidence time series data. While commonly used approaches for estimating the time-dependent reproduction number can be reliable when disease incidence is recorded frequently, such incidence data are often aggregated temporally (for example, numbers of cases may be reported weekly rather than daily). As we show, commonly used methods for estimating transmissibility can be unreliable when the timescale of transmission is shorter than the timescale of data recording. To address this, here we develop a simulation-based approach involving Approximate Bayesian Computation for estimating the time-dependent reproduction number from temporally aggregated disease incidence time series data. We first use a simulated dataset representative of a situation in which daily disease incidence data are unavailable and only weekly summary values are reported, demonstrating that our method provides accurate estimates of the time-dependent reproduction number under such circumstances. We then apply our method to two outbreak datasets consisting of weekly influenza case numbers in 2019–20 and 2022–23 in Wales (in the United Kingdom). Our simple-to-use approach will allow accurate estimates of time-dependent reproduction numbers to be obtained from temporally aggregated data during future infectious disease outbreaks.},

	abstract = {Slice sampling provides an easily implemented method for constructing a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. However, slice sampling has two major drawbacks: (i) it requires repeated evaluation of likelihoods for each update, which can make it impractical when evaluations are expensive or as the number of evaluations grows (geometrically) with the dimension of the slice sampler, and (ii) since it can be challenging to construct multivariate updates, the updates are typically univariate, which often results in slow mixing samplers. We propose an approach to multivariate slice sampling that naturally lends itself to a parallel implementation. Our approach takes advantage of recent advances in computer architectures, for instance, the newest generation of graphics cards can execute roughly 30, 000 threads simultaneously. We demonstrate that it is possible to construct a multivariate slice sampler that has good mixing properties and is eﬃcient in terms of computing time. The contributions of this article are therefore twofold. We study approaches for constructing a multivariate slice sampler, and we show how parallel computing can be useful for making MCMC algorithms computationally eﬃcient. We study various implementations of our algorithm in the context of real and simulated data.},

	abstract = {Evaluating forecasts is essential to understand and improve forecasting and make forecasts useful to decision makers. A variety of R packages provide a broad variety of scoring rules, visualisations and diagnostic tools. One particular challenge, which scoringutils aims to address, is handling the complexity of evaluating and comparing forecasts from several forecasters across multiple dimensions such as time, space, and different types of targets. scoringutils extends the existing landscape by offering a convenient and flexible data.table-based framework for evaluating and comparing probabilistic forecasts (forecasts represented by a full predictive distribution). Notably, scoringutils is the first package to offer extensive support for probabilistic forecasts in the form of predictive quantiles, a format that is currently used by several infectious disease Forecast Hubs. The package is easily extendable, meaning that users can supply their own scoring rules or extend existing classes to handle new types of forecasts. scoringutils provides broad functionality to check the data and diagnose issues, to visualise forecasts and missing data, to transform data before scoring, to handle missing forecasts, to aggregate scores, and to visualise the results of the evaluation. The paper presents the package and its core functionality and illustrates common workflows using example data of forecasts for COVID-19 cases and deaths submitted to the European COVID-19 Forecast Hub.},

	abstract = {Background The importance of infectious disease epidemic forecasting and prediction research is underscored by decades of communicable disease outbreaks, including COVID-19. Unlike other fields of medical research, such as clinical trials and systematic reviews, no reporting guidelines exist for reporting epidemic forecasting and prediction research despite their utility. We therefore developed the EPIFORGE checklist, a guideline for standardized reporting of epidemic forecasting research. Methods and findings We developed this checklist using a best-practice process for development of reporting guidelines, involving a Delphi process and broad consultation with an international panel of infectious disease modelers and model end users. The objectives of these guidelines are to improve the consistency, reproducibility, comparability, and quality of epidemic forecasting reporting. The guidelines are not designed to advise scientists on how to perform epidemic forecasting and prediction research, but rather to serve as a standard for reporting critical methodological details of such studies. Conclusions These guidelines have been submitted to the EQUATOR network, in addition to hosting by other dedicated webpages to facilitate feedback and journal endorsement.},

	abstract = {Mechanistic models enable the explicit representation of disease transmission processes, whereas statistical time series models represent these processes more implicitly. In light of the trade-offs between the two modeling approaches, we performed an empirical comparison of probabilistic forecasts from both modeling approaches for the daily incidence of COVID-19. The comparison is based on data across six large U.S. states over the first pandemic year. We evaluated probabilistic forecasts from ensembles of mechanistic models based on renewal equations and statistical time series models including autoregressive moving average (ARMA), generalized autoregressive score (GAS), and exponential smoothing (ETS) models. We find that forecasts from statistical time series models are overall at least as accurate as forecasts from mechanistic models. This result is driven by the relatively better performance of statistical models for longer forecast horizons (more than 7 days ahead). Moreover, statistical time series models better capture the volatility in the trajectory of COVID-19 incidence than mechanistic models. In scenarios with increased data uncertainty and increased variability, as they appeared during the COVID-19 pandemic, statistical time series models thus may serve as useful benchmark models.},

	abstract = {The time-varying reproduction number (Rt) is an important measure of transmissibility during outbreaks. Estimating whether and how rapidly an outbreak is growing (Rt > 1) or declining (Rt < 1) can inform the design, monitoring and adjustment of control measures in real-time. Estimating Rt comes with methodological and practical challenges, such as the choice of method, data requirements and data quality issues, which may not be immediately obvious. We carried out a scoping review to identify applications of real-time Rt estimation methods. Using EpiEstim as a case study, we evaluated the contexts in which Rt estimation methods have been used and identify unmet needs. We found that EpiEstim has been applied to a wide range of outbreaks, predominantly based on confirmed case data. We identified important issues around data used as inputs for EpiEstim, including challenges in data availability and data quality, as well as the interpretation of Rt estimates in the presence of varying reporting delays and changes in surveillance systems. Our analysis highlights the need for guidance regarding the use of Rt estimation methods in different contexts, additional tools to enhance their interpretation, and better communication of their limitations.},

We formalize a framework based on aggregation and transformation to build interpretable multivariate proper scoring rules. Aggregation-and-transformation-based (AT-based) scoring rules are able to target specific features of the probabilistic forecasts, including marginal calibration, dependency calibration, sharpness, conditional calibration, and the performance for specific outcomes. Existing multivariate proper scoring rules can be represented under this framework, and we further build on it to construct new scoring rules based on strictly proper scoring rules that incorporate desired conditional and unconditional forecast properties.},

Then, specific attributes of consistency, quality, and value of forecasts—in both deterministic and probabilistic form—are examined and illustrative examples are presented. Relationships among these three types of goodness are explored, and implications for the evaluation of forecasts in operational settings are briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {Forecast evaluation is a key component of developing reliable epidemic models. Transforming data before running models is a common statistical practice. Forecasting models for epidemiological data often operate on transformed scales such as the log scale, but model comparison and forecast evaluation are usually conducted on the original scale of the data, using incidence counts or deaths. In this work, we demonstrate how this practice of back-transforming forecasts can lead to unintuitive and misleading results. Strictly proper scoring rules, that is scoring rules that are optimised, in expectation, by the true predictive distribution, provide a principled framework for scoring forecasts in the form of predictive distributions and evaluating model performance. We show that if a proper scoring rule is applied to predictions after back-transformation, it may no longer be proper. This can lead to unexpected results in forecast comparisons, with models falsely appearing to have better or worse forecast performance than they do. We argue that to ensure valid model comparisons, forecast evaluation should be conducted on the same scale on which models were trained. We compare different proper scoring rules on transformed and non-transformed scales. Our results show that there is no direct relationship between performance on a transformed scale (e.g., the log scale) and the original scale. To complement scoring on the original scale, we therefore suggest that forecasts are also scored on a transformed scale such as the natural logarithm. Scores on log-transformed values can be interpreted in a multiplicative way as a probabilistic version of a relative error, a common concept in forecast evaluation, and can thus provide additional insight into the quality of predictive performance. In an application to COVID-19 and influenza forecasts, we show empirically that scoring on both the original and a transformed scale provides additional insights into forecast performance.},
